# TripleDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.0.

It was then extended with the NativeScipt Schematics as described in the NativeScript documentation: [CodeSharing](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/code-sharing/creating-a-new-project).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server of the web application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Have NativeScript installed and to a `tns run android` to start the Android app.
